BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

I accessed the fields that are in the env.config class,
and I created fields for repeating numbers in the dealer class.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

I used function notifyAll() to exit the waiting state of all objects.
I ran it in different situations to check the correctness.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

I added a condition in the function timerLoop() in the dealer class.
I ran it in different situations to check the correctness.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

I added a while loop with a wait function inside it with the appropriate conditions
for the player's thread and the artificial intelligence's thread.
I ran it in different situations to check the correctness.
